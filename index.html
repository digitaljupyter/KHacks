            <h1>K-Hacks Website!</h1>
            <p><b>K-Hacks</b> is a project destined to change the way the world views malware. 
            It works by recreating famous types of hacks and gives people more literacy in the
            computer virus field. The best way to learn is by example eh!</p>
            <p>This website contains links to the virus repositories, most are hosted on GitHub with
                more to come.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h1 style="color: gold"><a href="https://github.com/digitaljupyter/Peshka">Peshka</a></h1>

            <p><i><b>Peshka</b></i> is Russian for <i>Pawn</i> in Chess. A Pawn is the simplest unit in Chess therefore
            The name "Peshka" is used for the simple RAT program (might not be considered a RAT per-say.)</p>
            <p>This program basically takes a screenshot of the victim's current screen when they run the program
                and sends it to a Discord WebHook, now along with the screenshot it also sends the victim's IP address, now however
                this is not original whatsoever. Therefore it is named after a Pawn due to the simple nature of the program. It is definitely
                The least dangerous but is mainly used in Ransomware attacks such as the series of <b><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/newss-what-is-sextortion/view">Sextortion</a></b> attacks.
